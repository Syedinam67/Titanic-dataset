titanic datasets

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for data analysis and machine learning, particularly in the context of classification tasks. It contains information about the passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic ship, which sank in 1912.

The dataset typically includes features like:

PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.

Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Pclass: Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).

Name: Passenger name.

Sex: Gender of the passenger.

Age: Age of the passenger.

SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard.

Parch: Number of parents or children aboard.

Ticket: Ticket number.

Fare: Fare paid for the ticket.

Cabin: Cabin number.

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Common Analysis and Techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand trends and patterns (e.g., survival rates by class, age, gender).

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, especially for age and cabin.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features, like family size from SibSp and Parch.

Modeling: Applying machine learning models (like logistic regression, decision trees, etc.) to predict survival.

Applications

Education: Ideal for teaching data science and machine learning concepts.
Competitions: Used in platforms like Kaggle, where participants can submit their models to predict survival.

Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Download the Dataset: Get the Titanic dataset (commonly available in CSV format).
Open Tableau: Launch Tableau and select "Connect to a file," then choose "Text file" to upload your CSV.

Step 2: Connect to the Data

Load the Data: Once the dataset is loaded, you’ll see the fields in the Data pane.
Check Data Types: Make sure that fields are correctly categorized (e.g., “Survived” as a dimension, “Age” as a measure).

Step 3: Create Your First Visualization

Start with a Bar Chart:

Drag "Pclass" to the Columns shelf.
Drag "Survived" to the Rows shelf.
This gives you a basic bar chart showing survival rates by class.
Add Color:
Drag "Survived" to the Color shelf on the Marks card. This will differentiate between survivors and non-survivors.

Step 4: Explore More Visualizations

Survival by Gender:

Create a new sheet.
Drag "Sex" to the Columns shelf and "Survived" to the Rows shelf.
Again, add "Survived" to the Color shelf to visualize the data by gender.
Age Distribution:

Create a histogram to analyze age distribution.
Drag "Age" to the Columns shelf and then right-click on it to create a "Binned" field.
Drag the binned Age to Columns and "Survived" to Rows to see the distribution.

Step 5: Dashboard Creation

Create a Dashboard:
Click on the “New Dashboard” icon at the bottom.
Drag your sheets onto the dashboard area to create a cohesive view.
Add filters (e.g., by Class or Gender) to allow interactive analysis.

Step 6: Add Interactivity

Filters:

Drag fields (like "Pclass" or "Sex") to the Filters shelf on the dashboard.
Allow users to filter the visualizations dynamically.
Actions:

You can add actions (like highlight or filter) to enhance interactivity. Go to Dashboard > Actions to set these up.

Step 7: Analyze Insights

Draw Conclusions: Look for trends, such as:
Survival rates by class and gender.
Age groups with the highest survival rates.
How family size (using "SibSp" and "Parch") impacted survival.

Step 8: Save and Share

Save Your Workbook: Save your Tableau workbook for future reference.
Share Your Dashboard: You can publish your dashboard to Tableau Public or your organization's Tableau Server.
 
Step 9: Explore Further

Advanced Analysis: Consider using calculated fields to derive new insights (like family size or fare per person).
Predictive Analytics: If you want to dive deeper, you can integrate with R or Python for more complex predictive modeling.
